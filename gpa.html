                    of each class taken. The unweighted GPA is measured on a scale of 4 points. Thus, a score of 100 points
                    in a class would earn you 4 points toward your average. Each point in a class average (0-100) corresponds
                    to 0.1 points on a scale of 4 points. If you score a 90 in a class, you can count 3 points to your average.
                    An 80 corresponds to a 2.0, and a 70 corresponds to a 1.0, but anything below 70 points will contribute
                    nothing to your average. Your unweighted GPA is an average of each class' score on this 4 point scale.

                <h4 class="indent">A weighted GPA is a measure of relative academic success that takes into account the difficulty of each class
                    taken. Your school will have typically two or three set levels that each class is classified as one of.
                    Academic classes will be considered on a 4.0 scale, just as any class is for an unweighted GPA. Classes
                    that are on an Honors or Pre-AP level will typically be considered on a scale of 5 points. For each point
                    out of your 100 point class average that you deviate from a perfect 100, subtract 0.1 from 5 points.
                    This will be your score for that class. If your school offers AP classes as well, these will likely be
                    considered on a scale of 6 points. The score for this class is calculated just the same as the previous,
                    except you will subtract 0.1 points from 6 rather than from 5 or 4. Your weighted GPA will be the average
                    of each class' calculated score.

            <h1>Importance of GPA</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="indent">GPA is one of the primary considerations that colleges use to determine whether a student should be accepted
                or denied admission to their university. Most colleges will consider both your unweighted and weighted GPA's,
                so it is imperative that you do everything in your power to maintain both.
            </p>

            <h1>Cumulative GPA</h1>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="indent">Colleges will not see each year's weighted/unweighted GPA individually. Rather, they see the average of your
                GPA's from each year, both weighted and unweighted. Many students hear from their teachers and friends that
                junior year is most important, and without understanding what is meant by this, they often will justify putting
                forth less effort in the first half of high school on this basis. This is a tragic misunderstanding, however,
                because due to the nature of cumulative GPA, it is often too late to significantly change your GPA by the
                time you get to junior and senior year. If a student puts forth minimal effort in the first half of high
                school and earns a GPA representative of their lack of effort, they are usually stuck with a low GPA. This
                student can work to earn an exceptionally high GPA junior year as they should, but this will only count as
                one third of their cumulative GPA, with two thirds being calculated from their lower GPA earned in the first
                half of high school. It is much better for the student to hit the ground running on day 1 of freshman year
                as they will not need to make any adjustments or compensate later for a low GPA.
